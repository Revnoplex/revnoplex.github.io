    <p>There are a few conditons on adding the bot to your server:</p>
    <p>- do not abuse or spam the bot, there is a cooldown to prevent that from happening but this rule is in place just in case the cooldown doesnt work</p>
    <p>- do not try to exploit the bot. if you find a problem with the bot, please tell me immidiately and do not give any commands to the bot until i say its fixed.</p>
    <p>the bot has measurements in place to leave and blacklist an offending server</p>
